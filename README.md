# Uddevalla Climbing Store API - Backend School Project

This project is part of my education in backend development. The goal of this project was to create an API to manage customers, products, and orders for a fictional climbing store. The application is built as a console application where users can create, update, view, delete, and retrieve information about customers, products, and orders through interactive menus.

This project is part of my journey to becoming a backend developer and includes the use of C# and SQL for database interaction.
